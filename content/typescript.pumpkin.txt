#TOPIC: TypeScript
#DESC: Typed superset of JavaScript that adds static checking and tooling.

##CONCEPT: Type inference
##PREREQ:
##SUMMARY: TypeScript infers types from assignments and control flow.

Q: Type inference means:
A) All types must be explicitly written
B) The compiler can determine types without annotations
C) Types are removed at runtime
D) Types are fetched from npm
ANS: B
EXPL: TypeScript infers types from values and flow.

Q: Which case benefits most from explicit annotation?
A) Simple const value
B) Public function API
C) Local variable inside a function
D) A literal string assignment
ANS: B
EXPL: Annotating public APIs clarifies intent for callers.

##CONCEPT: Generics
##PREREQ: Type inference
##SUMMARY: Generics allow reusable types with type parameters.

Q: A generic function helps:
A) Remove all runtime checks
B) Preserve type information across inputs and outputs
C) Convert JS to TS automatically
D) Avoid interfaces
ANS: B
EXPL: Generics capture relationships between types.

Q: Which syntax defines a generic type parameter?
A) function fn(T) {}
B) function fn<T>() {}
C) function fn[ T ]() {}
D) function fn{T}() {}
ANS: B
EXPL: <T> declares a type parameter.

##CONCEPT: Unions and narrowing
##PREREQ:
##SUMMARY: Unions model multiple types; narrowing refines them via checks.

Q: A union type like string | number allows:
A) Only string values
B) Only number values
C) Either string or number values
D) No values
ANS: C
EXPL: Union types accept any member type.

Q: Type narrowing happens when:
A) You cast everything to any
B) The compiler recognizes a type guard
C) You disable strict mode
D) You use var instead of let
ANS: B
EXPL: Type guards narrow unions within a control flow path.

##CONCEPT: Structural typing
##PREREQ:
##SUMMARY: Types are compatible based on shape, not explicit declarations.

Q: TypeScript uses which typing system?
A) Nominal typing
B) Structural typing
C) Dynamic typing only
D) Duck typing at runtime
ANS: B
EXPL: Compatibility is based on structure, not named types.
TAGS: types

Q: Two interfaces are compatible when they:
A) Have the same name
B) Share the same property shapes
C) Are declared in the same file
D) Use the same extends clause
ANS: B
EXPL: Structural typing compares members by shape.
