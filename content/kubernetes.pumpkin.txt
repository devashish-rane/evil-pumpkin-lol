#TOPIC: Kubernetes
#DESC: Container orchestration platform for scheduling, scaling, and managing services.

##CONCEPT: Pods and deployments
##PREREQ:
##SUMMARY: Pods are the smallest deployable unit; deployments manage rollout and replicas.

Q: A Kubernetes Pod is:
A) A virtual machine
B) A group of one or more containers that share network and storage
C) A cluster-wide load balancer
D) A persistent volume
ANS: B
EXPL: Pods group containers with shared network namespace and storage.

Q: A Deployment primarily provides:
A) Node autoscaling
B) Declarative updates and replica management
C) Network policy enforcement
D) Storage provisioning
ANS: B
EXPL: Deployments manage replica sets and rollouts.

##CONCEPT: Services and networking
##PREREQ: Pods and deployments
##SUMMARY: Services provide stable networking for dynamic pod IPs.

Q: A ClusterIP Service exposes:
A) A public IP on every node
B) An internal virtual IP inside the cluster
C) An external load balancer
D) A DNS entry outside the cluster
ANS: B
EXPL: ClusterIP is internal-only by default.

A) ConfigMap
B) Ingress
C) DaemonSet
D) Secret
ANS: B
EXPL: Ingress defines HTTP routing rules.

##CONCEPT: Scheduling and resources
##PREREQ:
##SUMMARY: Schedulers place pods based on resource requests, limits, and constraints.

Q: CPU requests are used by the scheduler to:
A) Encrypt traffic
B) Decide pod placement
C) Allocate storage classes
D) Restart failed pods
ANS: B
EXPL: Requests inform scheduling decisions.

Q: A taint on a node does what?
A) Prevents all pods from scheduling forever
B) Repels pods unless they tolerate it
C) Deletes existing pods immediately
D) Disables the kubelet
ANS: B
EXPL: Taints repel pods without matching tolerations.

##CONCEPT: Config and secrets
##PREREQ: Pods and deployments
##SUMMARY: ConfigMaps and Secrets inject configuration into workloads.

Q: Secrets differ from ConfigMaps because:
A) They are namespaced per node
B) They are base64-encoded and intended for sensitive data
C) They are stored outside etcd by default
D) They cannot be mounted as files
ANS: B
EXPL: Secrets are base64-encoded and used for sensitive data.

Q: The most common way to update config without rebuilding an image is:
A) Hardcode it in the container
B) Use ConfigMaps and mount or env inject
C) Use node labels
D) Use pod annotations only
ANS: B
EXPL: ConfigMaps can be mounted or injected as env vars.
