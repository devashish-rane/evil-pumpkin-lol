#TOPIC: Docker
#DESC: Container runtime for packaging applications with isolated dependencies.

##CONCEPT: Images and layers
##PREREQ:
##SUMMARY: Docker images are built in layers that can be cached and shared.

Q: Docker image layers are:
A) Rebuilt on every run
B) Immutable and cached between builds
C) Stored only in memory
D) Created only for base images
ANS: B
EXPL: Layers are immutable and cached to speed up builds.
TAGS: images

Q: A smaller image size is best achieved by:
A) Adding more RUN steps
B) Using a multi-stage build
C) Disabling the build cache
D) Using root for all steps
ANS: B
EXPL: Multi-stage builds drop build-time dependencies.

##CONCEPT: Containers and runtime
##PREREQ:
##SUMMARY: Containers are isolated processes sharing the host kernel.

Q: Containers differ from VMs because they:
A) Have their own kernel
B) Share the host kernel
C) Require a hypervisor for every process
D) Cannot be stopped
ANS: B
EXPL: Containers are OS-level isolation sharing the host kernel.
TAGS: runtime

Q: The default process in a container is defined by:
A) EXPOSE
B) CMD or ENTRYPOINT
C) WORKDIR
D) VOLUME
ANS: B
EXPL: CMD and ENTRYPOINT define the container's default process.

##CONCEPT: Networking
##PREREQ: Containers and runtime
##SUMMARY: Docker networking connects containers with bridges, ports, and overlays.

Q: The default Docker network driver is:
A) host
B) bridge
C) overlay
D) macvlan
ANS: B
EXPL: bridge is the default network driver.

Q: Publishing a container port does what?
A) Exposes it on the host interface
B) Creates a new image layer
C) Encrypts container traffic
D) Changes the PID namespace
ANS: A
EXPL: Port publishing maps container ports to host ports.

##CONCEPT: Volumes and storage
##PREREQ:
##SUMMARY: Volumes persist data outside the container filesystem.

Q: Docker volumes are preferred over bind mounts when:
A) You need the host path visible
B) You want Docker-managed persistent storage
C) You need to edit files directly
D) You want no data persistence
ANS: B
EXPL: Volumes are managed by Docker and decouple storage from host paths.
TAGS: storage

Q: Removing a container automatically removes:
A) All named volumes
B) Anonymous volumes only
C) No volumes by default
D) The Docker image
ANS: C
EXPL: Volumes persist unless explicitly removed.
