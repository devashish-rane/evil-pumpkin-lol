#TOPIC: Kafka
#DESC: Distributed event log for high-throughput streaming and durable messaging.

##CONCEPT: Logs and partitions
##PREREQ:
##SUMMARY: Topics are split into partitions that append events in order.

Q: Ordering in Kafka is guaranteed:
A) Across all partitions of a topic
B) Only within a single partition
C) Only for compacted topics
D) Only for exactly-once producers
ANS: B
EXPL: Kafka preserves order within a partition.

Q: Partitioning helps Kafka scale by:
A) Storing all data on one broker
B) Spreading write load across brokers
C) Eliminating replication
D) Disabling consumer groups
ANS: B
EXPL: Partitions spread load and increase parallelism.

##CONCEPT: Consumer groups and offsets
##PREREQ: Logs and partitions
##SUMMARY: Consumers track offsets per partition to coordinate progress.

Q: Offsets in Kafka represent:
A) The number of brokers in a cluster
B) A position within a partition log
C) The timestamp of a message
D) A consumer ID
ANS: B
EXPL: Offsets are sequential positions within a partition.
TAGS: consumers

Q: When a consumer group rebalances, Kafka:
A) Deletes old offsets
B) Redistributes partitions among consumers
C) Compresses logs
D) Restarts the broker
ANS: B
EXPL: Rebalance reassigns partitions to active consumers in the group.

##CONCEPT: Producer acks and durability
##PREREQ:
##SUMMARY: Producer acknowledgments control durability vs latency tradeoffs.

Q: The strongest durability setting is achieved with:
A) acks=0
B) acks=1
C) acks=all
D) acks=leader
ANS: C
EXPL: acks=all waits for all in-sync replicas to acknowledge.

Q: Idempotent producers help prevent:
A) Slow consumers
B) Duplicate writes on retry
C) Log compaction
D) Partition reassignments
ANS: B
EXPL: Idempotence ensures retries do not create duplicates.

##CONCEPT: Streams and processing
##PREREQ: Consumer groups and offsets
##SUMMARY: Kafka Streams builds stateful processing on top of topics.

Q: A Kafka Streams state store is used to:
A) Store broker metadata
B) Hold local state for processing
C) Replace Zookeeper
D) Encrypt messages
ANS: B
EXPL: State stores keep local data for aggregations and joins.
TAGS: streams

Q: Exactly-once processing in Kafka Streams relies on:
A) Fire-and-forget writes
B) Transactional producers
C) Disabling replication
D) External locking
ANS: B
EXPL: EOS uses transactions to atomically write results and offsets.
