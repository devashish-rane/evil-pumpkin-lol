#TOPIC: System Design
#DESC: Principles for building reliable, scalable, and observable systems.

##CONCEPT: Load balancing
##PREREQ:
##SUMMARY: Load balancers distribute traffic across healthy backends.

Q: A layer 7 load balancer routes based on:
A) IP addresses only
B) HTTP host and path
C) MAC addresses
D) CPU usage only
ANS: B
EXPL: Layer 7 balancers can route on HTTP attributes.

Q: Health checks are used to:
A) Increase cache hit rate
B) Remove unhealthy instances from rotation
C) Speed up DNS propagation
D) Encrypt traffic
ANS: B
EXPL: Health checks keep bad instances out of the pool.

##CONCEPT: Caching
##PREREQ:
##SUMMARY: Caches reduce latency and backend load for repeated reads.

Q: A cache-aside strategy means:
A) The cache writes directly to the DB
B) The app reads from cache, then falls back to DB and fills cache
C) The cache is the only source of truth
D) The cache is prewarmed only
ANS: B
EXPL: Cache-aside loads data into cache on a miss.

Q: Cache invalidation is hard because:
A) It never affects correctness
B) Data can change outside the cache
C) It only applies to images
D) It is solved by TTLs alone
ANS: B
EXPL: Updates must invalidate stale entries to prevent inconsistencies.

##CONCEPT: Data consistency
##PREREQ:
##SUMMARY: Consistency models trade off freshness for availability.

Q: Eventual consistency means:
A) Reads always see the latest write
B) Reads may be stale temporarily
C) Writes are rejected
D) All replicas are locked
ANS: B
EXPL: Eventual consistency allows temporary staleness.

Q: A strongly consistent system typically requires:
A) Quorum or coordinated writes
B) No replication
C) UDP only
D) Clients to retry forever
ANS: A
EXPL: Strong consistency often needs coordinated writes or quorum.

##CONCEPT: Observability
##PREREQ:
##SUMMARY: Metrics, logs, and traces help understand system behavior.

Q: A high-cardinality label can:
A) Improve query performance
B) Increase metrics storage cost
C) Reduce alert noise
D) Disable logging
ANS: B
EXPL: High cardinality increases storage and query cost.
TAGS: observability

Q: Tracing is best for:
A) Tracking request flow across services
B) Counting daily active users
C) Storing binary blobs
D) Rotating logs
ANS: A
EXPL: Traces show end-to-end request paths.
